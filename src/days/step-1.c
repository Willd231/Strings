Functions I plan to implement today:

 1.strlen - returns the length of a string in bytes before the terminating char
 2.strcpy - copies a string to a destination this includes the terminating char 
 3.strncpy - copies up to n characters from source to dest and uses term char if source is shorter but can omit if source is longer
 4.strcat - concatenates/appends source string to end of destination string overwriting its /0 
 5.strncat - concatenates/appends up to n characters onto the end of a dest string and always adds the terminating character
